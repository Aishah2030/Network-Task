# Setting up a VPC and VSwitch in Alibaba Cloud

Create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and Virtual Switch (VSwitch) in Alibaba Cloud is a fundamental step for building your network infrastructure. In this lab, you will go through the process of creating a VPC and VSwitch in Alibaba Cloud using the Alibaba Cloud Management Console.

2. Create an ECS in VSwitch app-xyz-b and name it (app-xyz-b1)
